# fuyutaa's dotfiles!

These are used in this video on my channel, fuyutaa - hacking et cybersec.

## Description

These are the dotfiles for my DEMONDICE Arch Linux rice!
There are hotkeys, Window animations and more!
I tried to keep the configuration simple: for example, I did not used EWW (Elkowar's Wacky Widgets) but Polybar(one package, easier to configure...).

In the README.md, I present you the project, but if you want a full tutorial, look in the full-guide.md!

## If you like my dotfiles !

Feel free to give me a star on this repo ðŸ™‚!

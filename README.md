## Description

These are the dotfiles for my DEMONDICE Arch Linux rice!
There are hotkeys, Window animations and more!
I tried to keep the configuration simple: for example, I did not used EWW (Elkowar's Wacky Widgets) but Polybar(one package, easier to configure...).

In the README.md, I present you the project, but if you want a full tutorial, look in the full-guide.md!

## If you like my dotfiles !

Feel free to give me a star on this repo ðŸ™‚!

### Installing
* Install all the depedencies with pacman except st and picom
```shell
sudo pacman -S xorg bspwm sxhkd lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter feh dunst bat exa rofi starship polybar neovim git
```

* Install yay
```shell
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel
sudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
sudo chown -R  USERNAME:USERNAME yay
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

* Install [Arian8j2 picom fork](https://github.com/Arian8j2/picom) with yay
You must run the following command:
```shell
yay picom
```
And select the one that has "Arian8j2" in the name.

* Make the .config folder and subfolders
```shell
mkdir .config
mkdir .config/bspwm
mkdir .config/sxhkd
mkdir .config/polybar
mkdir .local
mdkir .local/bin
```

* Clone the repository

* Execute the following commands to set-up dotfiles:
```shell
cp -r ./config/* ~/.config
cp -r ./home/bashrc ~/.bashrc
cp -r ./home/Xresources ~/.Xresources
cp -r ./bin/* ~/.local/bin
```

* Compile my version of st:
```shell
cd ~/.config/st
./rebuild.sh
```

* Enable the GUI
```shell
systemctl enable lightdm
```

* Make polybar startup script be executable
```shell
chmod +x ~/.config/polybar/launch.sh
```

* Reboot your system and done!

Done! Easy right?
You won't have a fancy login page, but doesn't matter as it's just the login page.
